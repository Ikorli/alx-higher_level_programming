0x05. Python - Exceptions
Python

Errors in Python can be categorized into syntax errors and exceptions.

1. *Syntax Errors:* These occur when code violates Python's rules. Detected during compilation, they prevent program execution until fixed. Examples include misspelled keywords, missing colons, and incorrect indentation.

2. *Exceptions:* These arise during program execution due to errors or unexpected events. Unlike syntax errors, exceptions can be handled within code. They allow for graceful error handling, recovery, or informative termination.

Proper exception handling involves:
- Identifying specific exception types to handle.
- Using try-except blocks for catching exceptions.
- Providing relevant error handling or recovery mechanisms.
- Enhancing user experience with error messages or logging for debugging.
- Using the finally block for cleanup or finalization.

Exception handling contributes to robust and reliable code, enhancing software stability and quality. It's a vital practice in writing dependableÂ software.
